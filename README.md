The gray body model used to fit data is 

 $$ E_\lambda = (A_0 + A_1 \lambda + A_2 \lambda^2 + ... + A_n \lambda^n) \lambda^{-5} exp^{a + \frac{b}{\lambda}} $$

where the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are determined separately with

$$\ln{E_\lambda \lambda^5 = a + \frac{b}{\lambda}}$$

Additionally, the coefficients $A_0$, $A_1$, ..., $A_n$ are determined with $\frac{1}{E_\lambda^2}$ weighting using an assumption of constant percentage measurement error (See NBS TN 594-13 in Documentation).
